# Data Analysis in R

This is a repository hosting scripts for data analysis using R, which are based on Six Sigma methodology for contiunous data.
My intention is to give a broader outline in the series of [Medium articles](https://medium.com/@rafburzy/list/data-analysis-using-r-ee8d0237d53f)

This series includes the following projects:

1. Plotting continuous data and normality test.
2. Capability analysis.
3. Hypothesis testing - one sample t-test and groups comparing.
4. Simple linear regression.
5. Multiple linear regression.
6. Binary logistic regression.
7. Chi-square test.
